# Computer Hardware Components

## Computer hardware

Hardware it's the physical aspects of the computer.
It's everything we can see and touch.

Examples: hard drives; graphics cards, central processing unit.

A computer will only work if the hardware is working together with the software.

### Motherboard

The motherboard is the piece that connects all the pieces of the computer hardware.
Works like a brain, coordenating power across all components.

### Central Processing Unit (CPU)

CPU is where the data is processed.
The term 'clock speed' means the "speed" of the CPU, but it's not the only thing that it's important for the eficiency of the CPU.

### Random Acess Memory (RAM)

The RAM works together with the CPU, it stores information for a period of time.
This information is created by programs, and the RAM makes it "immediately" accessible.

This memory it's not secure, if the computer restarts the information is all gone.

The RAM is multitasking, it can support a lot of programs open, but the more support needed, bigger the RAM

### SSD and HDD

SSD and HDD are two types of storage drives.
They store programs, files or other kinds of informatioin of the computer, even if it is turned off.

HDD or Hard drives works by writing binary data onto spinning magnetic disks, or platters, by rotating at high speeds.

SDD stores the data on static NAND flash memory chips.

### Graphics Processing Unit (GPU)

The GPU processes vast amounts of graphical data.
A dedicated graphics card connects with the motherboard via an expansion slot.

### Power Supply Unit (PSU)

A PSU takes electricity from an external power source or laptop battery and passes it to the motherboard to power individual hardware components.

# Fundamental IT Skills

It's crucial to understand:

 - *Operating Systems*: Understand how OSes work, their vulnerabilities, and how to secure them (Windows, Linux, macOS).

 - *Networking*: Grasp networking concepts (TCP/IP, DNS, routing, firewalls) to identify and prevent network-based attacks.

 - *Hardware*: Know basic hardware components and security considerations (BIOS/UEFI, storage, peripherals).

 - *Virtualization*: Understand virtualization technologies (VMware, VirtualBox) and their security implications.

 - *Cloud Computing*: Learn about cloud service models (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS) and cloud security best practices.

 - *Scripting/Programming*: Develop scripting (Python, Bash, PowerShell) and programming skills to automate tasks and analyze code.

 - *Databases*: Understand database systems (SQL, NoSQL) and how to secure them against attacks like SQL injection.

 - *Troubleshooting*: Develop problem-solving skills to diagnose and fix IT issues, including security incidents.

# Connection Types

Network Connections enable the communication between devices, but it's relevant that their functions are different based on speed, reliability and purpose.

### Ethernet

- Is a wired connection type
- Used on local area networks (LANs)
- It provids high-speed, stable, and secure data transfer

### Wi-Fi

- Is a wireless connection type
- Provides mobility and flexibility
- Can be less reliable and slower than Ethernet due to signal interference or distance from the access point

### Bluetooth

- Is a short range wireless technology
- Used for connecting peripherals like headphones, keyboards or other devices
- It works in short distances, is useful for personal devices communication

### Fiber-optic connections

- Uses signals through glass or plastic fibers to transmit data at very high speeds over long distances
- Fiber is more reliable e faster than traditional copper cables, but more expensive

### Celular connections

- 4G and 5G
- Allow devices to connect to the internet via wireless celular networks
- Offers mobility and enables access to the internet from almost anywhere
- It depends a lot on the network coverage

### Near Field Communication (NFC)

- Is a short-range wireless technology
- Allows devices to communicate and exchange data over very short distances, typically up to 4 inches (10 cm)
- Used for applications such as contactless payments, electronic ticketing, and data transfer between devices 
- It operates at a frequency of 13.56 MHz and supports various modes, including peer-to-peer communication, card emulation, and reader/writer modes
- NFC enables quick and secure interactions with minimal setup, making it convenient for mobile payments, access control, and sharing information.

### Infrared (IR)

- Is a type of wireless communication technology
- Uses light waves in the electromagnetic spectrum to transmit data between devices 
- Used in short-range communication, commonly found in devices like remote controls, wireless keyboards and mice, and computer-to-printer communication

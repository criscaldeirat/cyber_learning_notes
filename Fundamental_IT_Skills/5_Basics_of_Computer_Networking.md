# Basics of Computer Networking

## The foundations of networking

Switches, routers, and wireless access points are the essential networking basics. Through them, devices connected to your network can communicate with one another and with other networks

### Switches

- Acts like a controller, connecting computers, printers, and servers to a network
- Allows devices to communicate with each other or other networks
- Allows to share information and resource allocation

There are two basic types of switches to choose from as part of your networking basics: 

- cloud-managed
- on-premises
    - It configures and monitors the LAN, giving more control of the network traffic.

### Routers

- Can connect multiple networks together
- Can connect networks to the internet
- Acts a dispatcher. It analyzes data being sent across a network, chooses the best route for data to travel, and sends it on its way

Routers come with additional features to make networking easier or more secure. Depending on your security needs, for example, you can choose a router with a firewall, a virtual private network (VPN), or an Internet Protocol (IP) communications system.

### Access Points

- It enables devices to connect wireless to a network

An access point acts like an amplifier for your network. While a router provides the bandwidth, an access point extends that bandwidth so that the network can support many devices, and those devices can access the network from farther away.

But an access point does more than simply extend Wi-Fi. It can also give useful data about the devices on the network, provide proactive security, and serve many other practical purposes.

### Wireless Networking

1. Centralized deployment

    The most common type of wireless network system, centralized deployments are traditionally used in campuses where buildings and networks are in close proximity. This deployment consolidates the wireless network, which makes upgrades easier and facilitates advanced wireless functionality. Controllers are based on-premises and are installed in a centralized location.  

2. Converged deployment

    For small campuses or branch offices, converged deployments offer consistency in wireless and wired connections. This deployment converges wired and wireless on one network device—an access switch—and performs the dual role of both switch and wireless controller.

3. Cloud-based deployment

    This system uses the cloud to manage network devices deployed on-premises at different locations. The solution requires Cisco Meraki cloud-managed devices, which provide full visibility of the network through their dashboards.
